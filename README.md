**Important!** There aren't many commits at this moment as we are currently helping with Tanoa Life and adding more website management tools! The project is still going on.

# Welcome to ArmiLife
Ever asked yourself what would happen if you would redo and combine the most successful mods ever created?  
We're tired of limits! Under this big Life Mod we combine all successful mods with a bunch of unique features that you've never seen before.
Apart from regular contents you know from Life Servers, ArmiLife includes Domination, Wasteland, DayZ and a good Roleplay at once!


## The Factions
Depending on your desires, you can choose between 3 featured Factions which also act as Governmental bodies - each with their own ideals and advantages.


## Management Tools - Outsourcing
In ArmiLife most administrative tasks must be done over the website. Manage or found your Job, Faction, Gang or Company. Adjust your Sectors or get information about your Account. Make political decisions or create an account without being on the server. Your changes on the website affect all associated servers in realtime! 


## Donation System
ArmiLife rejects any form of game breaking perks or rewards such as extra paychecks or exclusive content.  
We may limit some content factionwise due roleplay and/or realism reasons - but you can still own such content over theft, corruption or other reasonable roleplay actions.
Our upcomming donator system shall reward those who contribute! Of course we need an income to cover the server costs, but those costs will be made public. From there on donators decide how their donation is shared!  
  
Every contributing modder or scripter can be rewarded by the donator. 
In return donators get points awarded which they can use to prioritze certain feature requests or suggestions. Note that we still reserve the right to reject any suggestion by refunding all spend donation points. 


## Our Rules
Unlike other servers, for our official servers we justify every of our rules and work those out with the community! Yet, we encourage to solve RP-Actions with RP-Consequences and provide many ways to do so. Support might only be contacted if there's a clear breach stated rules such as deathmatching, cheating or harassment (sexual, bulling, insulting...).  

When it comes to jobs, we discourage any sort of persistent departments! It's okay to form groups and to takeover the lead sometimes, but we want to prevent the restriction of certain features or game contents for a small group of players, such as "specialized" units. 

## Other key features  
* **Closed economy**  
Thanks to our accounting system and database-logfiles, we can ensure that no one keeps things that he unrightful obtained (i.e. through cheating). Paychecks and prices are calculated by market stocks and real life references.
* **Map Interaction**  
We always encouraged to use the map content and provided the scripts for it. We dislike things like "fishing areas", "mining places" or unused/ignored mapobjects. ArmiLife lets you interact with what's around you! Fish what's actually under your boat, interact with whats really in front of you (collect branches, fall trees, use phone cells, etc.)
To add some more bunch of realism, the interactions can depend on which item you currently hold in your hand(s).
* **Domination**
The entire map is covered into sectors. Each sector provides different perks, i.e. good amount of electricty generation, access to rarer resources, cities or villages to provide living rooms and tax income, ports or airports to boost your imports and exports, research facilities to access exclusive equipments, etc. - Gangs and Governments of course both have great interests in controlling these sectors - and they can do so by destroying/jamming important points followed by capturing the sectors flag or base. The war system provides a great base for those who want to battle while leaving those who wish to play peacefully.
* **Wasteland**
There are many leftovers of the past, and you may find them when and where you least expect them. Dive in the oceans, search in the ruines or find new treasures in the depths of the jungles.
* **Artificial Intelligence (DayZ)**
AIs help you in almost every of your daily tasks, they operate the shops, they treat you in the hospital or provide company to the old. But they are strong and easy to manipulate, many criminals use them for their doings - don't get fooled, it'll cost your life.
* **Many more ass-kicking features, but we don't want to take the surprise**
